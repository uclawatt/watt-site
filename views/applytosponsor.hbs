                <p class="fam-card-description">UCLA WATT (Women Advancing Technology through Teamwork) is the UCLA chapter of IEEE-WIE (Women in Engineering). WATT seeks to create a space that wholeheartedly supports women and other minorities in Electrical and Computer Engineering. We build a community of intelligent, confident, and socially aware engineers through our shared interest in EE and CE. The HogWATTs mentorship program matches first and second-year students with upperclassmen and alumni who guide their mentees through their time at UCLA, providing help academically, technically, socially, and professionally. Additionally, we hold technical and professional workshops like networking dinners to help our members advance their skills and provide opportunities to connect within the engineering community.                </p>
                <p class="fam-card-description">WATT is unique in our focus on advocacy and mental health. We hold frequent workshops pertaining to social issues such as unconscious bias and imposter syndrome, LGBT issues, and health issues like depression and anxiety. We care not only about the academic and professional success of our members, but also about their well-being and social responsibility.</p>
